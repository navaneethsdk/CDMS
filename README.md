With plenty of deadly and contagious diseases like the COVID-19
on the rise, an efficient disease management system has become the need
of the hour. CDMS aims to tackle down this problem by introducing a
meticulous disease control system with emphasis laid on isolating
patients and assuring efficient utilisation of hospital services.

MINI-WORLD: Hospital

DESCRIPTION:
1. Hospitals are organised into number of isolation wards each of
which has a unique identification number. It will be managed by a
particular doctor
2. Each patient will be assigned to an isolation ward. The isolation
ward is specified by the stage of the disease the patient is going
through
3. Each doctor is assigned to one department but can work on
multiple isolation wards. We keep track of doctors’ working hours
as well as patients’ progress record
